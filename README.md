## 📄 Project Abstract
Recommender systems are critical in the modern information era for filtering vast amounts of data. This project focuses on **Collaborative Filtering**, investigating both:
1.  **Memory-Based Approaches:** User-User and Item-Item filtering.
2.  **Model-Based Approaches:** Matrix Factorization and Deep Learning techniques.

We analyzed user preferences to predict ratings and provide personalized suggestions, evaluating performance using standard metrics like RMSE on the Netflix dataset.

## 🚀 Key Implementations
The project covers the following techniques:
* **Classic CF:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based on user/item similarity.
* **Matrix Factorization:** SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and ALS.
* **Neural Collaborative Filtering:** (If applicable based on your code)
* **Evaluation:** Benchmarking against the Netflix Prize baseline.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `report/`: The comprehensive technical report (PDF) detailing methodology and results.
* `src/`: Source code for the recommendation algorithms (Python/Jupyter Notebooks).
* `data/`: (Optional) Sample datasets or scripts to fetch the Netflix data.
* `plots/`: Performance comparison charts and visualizations.

## 📊 Results & Analysis
Our findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity in Memory-based vs. Model-based approaches. Detailed performance graphs can be found in the report.
